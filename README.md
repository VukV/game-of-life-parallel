### Concurrent Programming

Project for Parallel Algorithms course at Faculty of Computing.

The goal of the project was to learn various concepts of concurrent programming by implementing John Conway's Game Of Life in four different ways:
1. Using Threads, Mutex, Semaphores and Conditions
2. Using Threads and Queues
3. Using Processes and Queues
4. Using Process Pool
